About me:
I am a Computer Science Graduate Student at Northeastern University. 

I have worked as an Application Developer at IBM India for 2 years.
The project I worked on during my tenure was iLMS (Lead Management System for Airtel, India). It involved designing user-interactive and dynamic pages using HTML, CSS,Javascript and AJAX. The system is integrated to various other call-center applications and lead sources using Web Service clients, and similarly to security framework using SQL procedures.
So the project basically manages the total clientele and the complete lifecycle of every lead.

Some of the academic projects I have worked on are:
1) Event Scheduler: An event scheduler in Java to plan a two-day event for the participants across multiple countries to maximize attendance on consecutive days. The project reads an API of a list of participants and decides the attending date for each partner; and then posts the JSON body to show the response.

2)Information Retrieval System :Designed an information retreival system, i.e crawler, indexer, BM25, TFIDF and Lucene retrieval models in Python, performed query expansion; evaluated system performance in terms of retrieval effectiveness.

3)Crossword Solving Agent: Project in Java for solving crossword puzzles using uninformed search and backtracking search algorithms. The model proves the effectiveness of constraint specification in solving crossword or similar puzzles.

4)Simulation of a PC through an Android Device: The Android App uses Wi-Fi Protocol to communicate with Wi-Fi enabled PC which acts as Server to completely simulate a personal computer; hence can be used as a secondary display device to maximize productivity.
(most of the above code can be found in my Github repository)
